- [ ] every bench test run for two types: pure cli call and wrapped python api 

## notes

- [x] maybe add support to windows, it is not now because CrawlPath is using '/'. (boundary is take care by Path)
- [ ] minimize the maintenance effort by having auto remove data repo validation and fire issues.

- [ ] have clear data repo onboarding instruction (one trait to impl).
